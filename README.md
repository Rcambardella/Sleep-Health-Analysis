# 🛌 Sleep Health & Lifestyle Data Analysis

## 📘 Project Overview

This project explores a real-world dataset of 3374 individuals, analyzing how lifestyle and health factors such as **stress levels**, **physical activity**, **BMI**, and **occupation** influence **sleep duration** and the likelihood of having a **sleep disorder**.

The goal is to simulate the work of a professional data analyst: cleaning raw data, testing hypotheses, exploring trends, and communicating actionable insights to stakeholders.

## 🎯 Key Business Questions

- Do high stress levels significantly reduce sleep duration?
- Is there a relationship between physical activity and sleep?
- Which occupations and BMI categories report the shortest sleep?
- What factors are most associated with reported sleep disorders?

---

## 🔍 Summary of Insights

- 🔴 Individuals with **high stress levels** sleep ~1.2 hours less on average.
- 🏥 **Healthcare professionals** and **tech workers** report the shortest sleep durations.
- 🟢 There is a mild positive correlation between **physical activity** and sleep.
- ⚠️ **Obesity (BMI > 30)** is associated with both **reduced sleep** and higher incidence of sleep disorders.

> These findings can guide wellness app design, HR health initiatives, or public health interventions focused on sleep hygiene.

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- **Data cleaning & preprocessing** with `pandas`
- **EDA & visualization** using `seaborn` and `matplotlib`
- **Hypothesis testing** with group comparisons and exploratory insights
- **Project structure** using folders, saved charts, and reusable functions
- **Communication of results** in business-style summary

---

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Python 3.11
- Jupyter Notebook / VSCode
- `pandas`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`
- Git & GitHub for version control
- [Optional: `scipy` for t-tests]

## 🚀 Next Steps / Extensions

- Adding a simple **predictive model** to classify likelihood of sleep disorder
- Building a **dashboard** with Streamlit or Tableau
- Using SQL to analyze structured version of this data

## 💼 About This Project

This project was completed as part of my journey to become a data analyst. It's designed to reflect the types of questions and skills used in real analyst roles — from messy data to meaningful insights.

📬 I'm open to internships, junior data analyst roles, or contract opportunities.
